# wildSENSE: Tracking and Monitoring Wildlife using WSN

This project demonstrates the application of Wireless Sensor Networks to track and monitor wildlife. 
Few important features of the implemented sensor network can be summarized as:
- The network deploys a distributed distance-vector based routing technique for communication between the sensor nodes and the Gateway
- Self-organizing network: The networks can automatically formulate shortest route; new nodes can be seamlessly integrated into the network at any point of time
- Failure Recovery: Failed nodes can be detected and alternative route can be established

The project was built using Contiki and Zolertia RE-Motes were used as the sensor nodes. A GUI was developed using Qt for visualization of the routing path and the routing tables. This project has been completed as part of the Wireless Sensor Networks Lab at TUM.
